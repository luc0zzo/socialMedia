        <h1>what is social media?</h1>
        <p>
          <p> 
            Social media has become incredibly prevalent in today's world. According to
            <a href="https://datareportal.com/social-media-users">Datareportal</a>, they
            are utilized by a staggering <b>61.4%</b> of the global population, accounting
            for 4.95 billion people. Undoubtedly, the significance of this topic cannot be
            overstated, especially with Facebook retaining its position as the
            <a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2022-global-overview-report">most widely used</a>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            social media platform. While social media has bestowed numerous benefits, such
            as fostering global connectivity and enabling instant communication and news
            sharing, it also comes with its fair share of drawbacks. One concern is the
            algorithm's ability to construct personalized profiles based on user behavior,
            predicting and influencing our actions. Additionally, social media addiction
            is a growing issue, with approximately 10% of Americans reportedly addicted,
            according to
            <a href="https://www.addictionhelp.com/social-media-addiction/statistics/">
            Addiction Help</a>
            . Shockingly, this number skyrockets to 40% among teenagers. According to
            research by Common Sense, teenagers spend an average of 7 hours and 22 minutes
            on screens each day, while children aged 8â€“12 accumulate an average of 4 hours
            and 44 minutes of screen time daily.

          <h1>privacy of social media</h1>
          <p>
            Privacy concerns on social media extend to the technical realm, involving the collection, storage, and utilization of user data. Advanced algorithms are employed to analyze user behavior and preferences, often for targeted advertising. Striking a balance between personalization and protecting user privacy involves implementing robust encryption, secure authentication processes, and transparent data management practices. Additionally, users should stay informed about the intricacies of privacy settings, opt for two-factor authentication, and regularly review app permissions to ensure a more technically resilient and privacy-conscious online experience.
